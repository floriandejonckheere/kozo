_Kōzō_ (構造) is an open-source tool to manage your cloud resources based on the [infrastructure as code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) principle.
It leverages the power of [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) to allow you to declare your infrastructure in your favourite language.
